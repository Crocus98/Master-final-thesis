## Regex Limitations
The regular expressions supported by our compiler have the following limitations:

- Regular expressions where the results differ between greedy and lazy matching (e.g., .+, .+?) are **not** supported.
- The beginning anchor ^ must either appear at the beginning of the regular expression or be in the format (<Any Characters>|^). Additionally, the section containing this ^ must be non-public (`is_public: false`).
- The end anchor $ must appear at the end of the regular expression.
- Regular expressions that, when converted to DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), include transitions to the initial state are **not** supported (e.g., .*).
- Regular expressions that, when converted to DFA, have multiple accepting states are **not** supported.
